# Section 3.1. File is ...
- File is 전통적으로는 정보를 저장하는 most basic unit, 
- 이때에는 단순히 data, program 등을 file로 생각한다. 
- 그러나, modern os의 관점에서 file은 abstract object로 read and write라는 unified interface로
- 단순 data or program을 넘어 hardware device까지 다루기 위한 하나의 system이 되었다. 
- file is stored storage device and 보통의 경우 kernel은 file을 a sequence of bytes로 생각하며
- 실제 그 file이 무엇인지는 application이 해석하게 된다.

---

- traditional definition vs modern OS concepts
    - In tradition, the most basic unit for storing infomation.
        - traditional definition for user.
        - data, programs, and etc. are naturally archived as file.
    - In modern concepts, abstract object to read and write data.
        - for modern OS concepts, especially in Linux/UNIX
        - extansion of concept of file
- a sequence of `m` byte
    - no matter what it means for OS, that is only for application
- unified interface to read and write data.
    - manage manythings as file => use same system call interface like read/write/open/close to access device and data
    - Uniform View => no matter where it is stored, what it is contained, what hardware system it is, same action to call (`read`, `write`, ...)
    - use `read` function, when read data on disk or take packet on network socket as well.
    - Physical devices also can be represented as file.
        - keyboard input => stdin => read like file
        - displaying to monitor => stdout => write like file
    - e.g., echo hello > /dev/tty
        - in user's perspect, just writing at `tty`
        - in real mechanism, write()
        → VFS
        → inode 확인
        → character device file 확인
        → tty driver 호출
        → terminal hardware 출력 => `hello` not be stored in `tty`
- Typically, stored on storage devices (e.g., SSD, HDD, Even Memory)

# Section 3.2. Type of File

1. Ordinary File (== Regular File)
    - store text or binary data.
    - is stored on secondary storage device.
    - kernel do not distinguish what it is, only application do
    - for kernel, it is just a sequence of m bytes.

---

2. Directory
    - a set(array) of directory entries.
    - directory entry is mapping of file-name and inode-number.
```text
<file-name, inode-number>
directory
[
    ("a.txt", inode 15),
    ("b.txt", inode 29),
    ("dir", inode 40)
]
```
    - inode-number (index, refference) => inode
    - inode is a structure that contains 실체 and metadata about file.
        - not have file-name, have where it is on disk, file-size, ...
        - why is not file-name contained in inode => inode is identity of file.
        - "a.txt" → inode 3512, "b.txt" → inode 3512 => hard rink
    - for integrity, only kernel can have permission to write to directory.
    - is the pointer-like that contain other file's name and infomation to find it.
    - finally, it is 특정 format의 binary data를 가진 regular-like file
    - namespace == path 구조?? tree 형태로 된?
    - using directories to hierarchically organize files 
    - directory can contain other directories
        - `dir_a[ ("dir_aa", inode nn) ]`
        - `dir_a`: parent directory of `dir_aa`
        - `dir_aa`: sub-directory of `dir_a`

---

3. Special File (== Device File)
"device file은 regular file처럼 디스크 data block에 저장되는 파일이 아니라,
filesystem namespace 안에 존재하는 special entry이다.
write/read 시 filesystem storage로 가지 않고,
kernel은 inode의 device 정보를 통해 적절한 device driver(kernel code)를 호출한다.
따라서 device file의 실질적 동작은disk-backed data가 아니라, kernel memory 내부 subsystem과 연결되어 있다."
    - abstract hardware device as file for unified interface.
    - stored(reside) in memory => disk에storing 실제 data 하지 않음
        - regular file => mapping to storage
            - block pointer => where space of storage?
        - device file => mapping to device program
            - major number, minor number => what driver?
    - character device file vs block device file
        - c => like data stream, sequential acces, stream I/O 
        - b => fixed size unit data, random access, storage I/O

4. etc.) Symbolic Link, FIFO (Named Pipe), Socket
    - Symbolic Link: has other file's path-name as data
    - FIFO: for IPC(Inter-Process Communication)
    - Socket: for network

---

## Text File vs. Binary File

- Text file
    - general file with ASCII characters 
    - documents, programs, shell scripts etc.
    - human-readable form

- Binary file
    - non-text file which has data in binary form
    - computer-readable form
    - typically contains data that is meaningful only when processed by a program (e.g., executable file)

- e.g.
```bash
~$ file ./.bashrc
./.bashrc: ASCII text
~$ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=05dad2c279f7651722809fa75adba6bf9ab1c209, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```

## File Mode and File Permission

- e.g.
```bash
~$ ls -l test.c
-rwxr-x-wx 1 owner-name group-name 426 Apr  2 15:25 syscall.c
```

- -rwxr-xr-x: file mode representation
- file mode: [file type][permission bit]
    => -: file type
    => rwxr-x-wx: permission bit

- **file type**: first charcter of file mode
| Symbol | File Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-` | regular file | 일반 파일 |
| `d` | directory | 디렉터리 |
| `c` | character device | 문자 단위로 입출력하는 장치 파일 |
| `b` | block device | 블록 단위로 입출력하는 장치 파일 |
| `l` | symbolic link | 다른 파일/디렉터리를 가리키는 링크 |
| `p` | FIFO / pipe | 프로세스 간 통신용 파이프 |
| `s` | socket | 프로세스 간 네트워크/IPC 통신용 소켓 |

- **file permission**: Which users or a group of users can access a specific file/directory.
    - permission type
        - r: read permission
        - w: write permission
        - x: execution permission
        - -: no permission assigned
    - three user-based permission groups
        - owner(or user)(u): the owner permission apply only the owner of the file/diretory
        - (owner) group(g): the group permission apply only the group that has been assigned to the file/directory
        - others(o): the others permission apply to all other users on the system
    - the first three bits are for owner, the second ones are for group, and the last ones are for others.
        - rwxrwxrwx
        - e.g., rwxr-x-wx => owner: rwx / group: r-x / others: -wx
    - Octal representations
        - Each permission groups has three permission bits
        - => Can be represented octal number.
        - e.g., rwxr-x-wx => 111 101 011 => 753
    - Execution permission
        - for regular file: execute a file.
        - for directory: view the contents of a directory.

---

## Absolute Path vs. Relative Path
- Absolute Path
    - /home/${USER}/a/b/c/d
- Relative Path
    - e.g., working diretory path: /home/${USER}/a/b/c/d
    - parent diretory: c => .. 
        - b => ../..
    - current directory: d => .
    - user's home directory: /home/${USER} => ~

### =====Linux Commands=====

1. chmod
<!--
$ chmod mode file_or_directory
    - mode = three octal digits (e.g., 755, 644, 400)
    - mode = [u|g|o]+[+|-][r|w|x] (e.g., u+x, g-x, o+r)
The normal user can modify the permission for files/directories that the user owns
The root user can modify the permissions on all files/directories regardless of it’s owner
