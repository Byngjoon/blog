# What is Data Structures about?

Data Structures is the study of how to organize, store, and manage data **efficiently** in a computer system.

It focuses on designing ways to:
1.	Store data (**structure**)
    How to structure data (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, etc.)

2.	Access and modify data (**operations**)
    How to insert, delete, search, sort, and traverse data

3.	Optimize performance (**time & space complexity**)
    Measuring performance using time & space complexity (Big-O notation)
    Choosing the right data structure for different problems (e.g., using stacks for undo history)


# Why we learn Data Structures?
To solve computational problems **efficiently**.
