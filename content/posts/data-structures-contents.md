	•	Explore strings as character arrays and string manipulation techniques
## Chapter 01. Array ADT
- Array basics (1D, 2D)/ One-dimensional and multidimensional arrays
- Memory layout of arrays
- String as null-terminated char array
- Common string functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, etc.)
- Array vs pointer in function parameters

- Array-based operations
- Strings in C (`char[]`, `'\0'` termination)
- Limitations of arrays
