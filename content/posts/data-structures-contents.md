Chapter 00. [Introduction to Data Structures]({{< relref "posts/data-structures-00.md" >}})
- What is Data Structures about?
- Why we learn Data Structures?
- Data Type vs Data Structure
- Learn about Abstract Data Types (ADT)

Chapter 01. Arrays & Strings
	•	Learn how arrays store elements in contiguous memory
	•	Understand array operations: indexing, insertion, deletion
	•	Explore strings as character arrays and string manipulation techniques

Chapter 02. Linked Lists
	•	Understand node-based storage using pointers
	•	Explore singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
	•	Compare linked lists with arrays in terms of performance and use cases

Chapter 03. Stacks and Queues
	•	Learn the principles of LIFO (Stack) and FIFO (Queue)
	•	Implement stack and queue using arrays and linked lists
	•	Understand real-world applications like Undo, BFS, etc.

Chapter 04. Recursion & Call Stack
	•	Understand how recursion uses the call stack
	•	Compare iterative and recursive approaches
	•	Optimize recursive functions and avoid stack overflow

Chapter 05. Trees
	•	Learn tree terminology (root, leaf, height, etc.)
	•	Explore binary trees and traversal methods
	•	Understand binary search trees (BST) and balanced trees
	•	Study heaps and priority queue implementation

Chapter 06. Hashing
	•	Learn how hash tables map keys to values

Chapter 07. Graphs
	•	Explore graph representations: adjacency matrix and list
	•	Implement DFS and BFS for traversal
	•	Understand directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted graphs
	•	Apply graph algorithms: shortest path, topological sort

Chapter 08. Advanced Structures
	•	Study trie for prefix-based string search
	•	Learn disjoint set (union-find) and its use in connectivity problems
	•	Understand segment trees and Fenwick trees for range queries
	•	Get a glimpse of B-Trees and skip lists

Chapter 09. Complexity & Trade-Offs
	•	Analyze time and space complexity of data structures
	•	Learn how to choose the right data structure for a given problem
	•	Discuss trade-offs between speed, memory, and implementation complexity

Chapter 10. Practice & Implementation
	•	Implement core data structures in code (C/Python/Java)
	•	Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, Baekjoon, etc.
	•	Practice debugging and test-driven development
	•	Learn how to recognize and apply structures in real-world scenarios
